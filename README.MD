## How it was developed

The MERN stack was used to build this app. Which means that mongoDB, Node.js and Express.js was used to build the API, also MSC architecture was adopted.

The user interface was built with React. React hooks and Context API was used as well to control data between React components.

Finally, for deploy, Heroku and MongoDB Atlas were used.
